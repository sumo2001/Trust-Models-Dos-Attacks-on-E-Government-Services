# Trust-Models-Dos-Attacks-on-E-Government-Services
With the growth of internet and availability of internet, government services have also taken up an online path to serve the people better. E-government services provide greater efficiency than a normal office method, this way people can look up their info or process their query without waiting for much time at the office for the people over there to fetch their records. With the growth of these services their security is also a major problem to be dealt with. Any server accessible to the public will be attacked at some point or the other by an attacker. there will be some people that misuse them or exploit these services that are present in cloud servers or standalone servers for their own benefits or just for fun. One of the most common attacks on services like these is Denial of service attack. In denial of service attack the attacker sends unwanted traffic towards the server or some command to make the system crash. Attacker abuses the systems so that other people canâ€™t access the resources present on these systems. To provide security to these systems we have thought about using a trust model that categorizes the users into trustable or not trustable. A lot of Trust models have been published in the past years for various other use cases, we chose some features from them to fit our use case in the best way possible.
